We begin by loading the required packages.

```{julia}
using Revise                      # <1>
using RainwaterHarvesting         # <2>
```

1. `Revise` allows us to update code without restarting Julia.
2. We load the `RainwaterHarvesting` package that contains our simulation tools.

### Setting the file path

Next, we specify the path to the rainfall data file and read it in.

```{julia}
filepath = "data/3.txt" # <1>   
rainfall_data = RainfallData(filepath) # <2>
```

1. This is the path to the rainfall data file for the station of interest.
2. This creates a `RainfallData` object containing the rainfall data for the specified station.

If we dig under the hood a bit, we can see that there are two main pieces of information:

- `station_info`: a dictionary containing information about the station, such as its name and location.
- `annual_data`: a dictionary mapping years to `AnnualRainfallData` objects, each containing the date and precipitation data for a given year.

### Plotting the Data

We can plot the data for one or all of the years to verify that it looks correct.

```{julia}
plot(rainfall_data) # <1>
```

1. This `plot` function is defined in [viz.jl](./RainwaterHarvesting/src/viz.jl) and is a thin wrapper around the Plots.jl package.

### Discussion

Are the available data sufficient for meaningful risk assessments?
The data provide lots of information over a long period of time: from around 1973 to 2024. This is enough information to assess risk in the future, but the current graph provided is not the only graph we will need. It is hard to read the specific data about different times of the year. It's almost impossible to tell exactly how long (yearwise) the gaps are. If there were more marks signifying each year, that would be helpful. We also don't have additional data we need about droughts, particularly rainy seasons, floods, and other natural disasters. 
Research on major droughts in Ceara, Brazil, and discussion:

Source: https://www.riotimesonline.com/brazil-faces-its-most-severe-drought-in-recent-history/
According to my research, there were droughts in 2015 and from 1990-1993. In the graph, I don't really see this data very strongly. The peaks of rainfall are definitely lower during these years, but there are similarly low peaks during other years that I didn't find in my research as being drought years. 
Having missing data can greatly affect how well we analyze rainfall and drought data because they can contradict each other and they can make it harder to plan for the future if we are doing research based on inaccurate data. Having missing data can also make the researcher think they are looking at a drought, when in reality it's just missing data. For my analysis, I don't have any missing data, so it's difficult to see how droughts would line up with or affect potential spots of missing data. Without addition data or research, I would have assumed that there were droughts in 1991 and 2010-2011, where the data is more sparse. 

## Understanding the Theoretical Model

### Discuss limiting assumptions and approximations in the model.
The biggest limiting assumption is that each house only uses 74.1 liters of water a day. Compared to my family's water usage, this is a very small amount of water. Especially for a large, 5-8 person family. This assumption can skew data as it can be an inaccurate representation of water usage and can lead to a project that doesn't truly benefit the families. Another limiting assumption is that families only use water from the tank starting at the 151st day of the year. This assumption is based on the estimate that the rainy season lasts on average 150 days. This approximation, while probably accurate, doesn't take into account that the rainy season may be significantly shorter than this during some years, significantly longer, or may start and end a week earlier or later some years. 

### Discuss how you might modify the model to relax these assumptions. Provide mathematical equations.
The consumption, C_t, which is based on the assumption that families use either 0 or 74.1 liters of water a day, can be adjusted. Here, we could change the equation to model consumption based on the number of people in the house. According to the National Water and Sanitation Agency in Brazil, rural Brazilians on average use 70-120 liters of water per person per day. Based on this assumption, consumption could be changed to be modeled as C_t = 95x, day of year > 150, x = number of people in house. This takes 95, the average between 70 and 120, but keeps the days of the year when water is needed at 151-365. This also accounts for the assumption that multiple people live in the house. To adjust the days when water is needed, we could take a conservative approach and add a week onto each end, assuming that the dry season could last a week longer either at the beginning or the end. The equation would then look more like:
$$
C_t = \begin{cases}
    95x & \quad \ 7 > text{day of year} > 143 \\
    0 & \quad \ 7 \leq text{day of year} \leq 143 \\
\end{cases}
    x = text{number of people living in house}
$$

## Model Implementation and Testing

### Defining the Model Parameters

We can define the model parameters with sensible default values.
You will have the opportunity to change these values later.

```{julia}
#| output: false
param = ModelParameters(          # <1>
    runoff_coefficient=0.95,      # <2>
    roof_area_m2=50.0,            # <3>
    first_flush_mm=2.0,           # <4>
    tank_capacity_L=16000.0       # <5>
)
```

1. This creates a `ModelParameters` object with the specified parameters.
2. The runoff coefficient ($\eta$) is a measure of how much of the rain that falls on the roof ends up in the tank.
3. The roof area ($A$) is the area of the roof that the rain falls on.
4. The first flush volume ($V_f$) is the volume of rain that is discarded because it is dirty.
5. The tank capacity ($V_\text{max}$) is the maximum volume of the tank.

### Running the Simulation for One Year

Let's run the model for the year 1981.

```{julia}
rainfall_1981 = rainfall_data.annual_data[1981]    # <1>
results_1981 = run_timesteps(rainfall_1981, param) # <2>
p1 = plot(results_1981)                                 # <3>
```

1. We select the annual rainfall data for the year 1981.
2. We run the simulation for the year 1981.
3. We plot the results, again using a `plot` function defined in [viz.jl](./RainwaterHarvesting/src/viz.jl).

To compare rainfall and tank volume:

```{julia}
p2 = plot(rainfall_1981)
plot(p2, p1, layout=(2, 1), size=(1000, 700), link=:x)
```

Observe how the tank's water level responds to rainfall events.
Note any periods when the tank runs dry or overflows.

### Reliability Analysis

We can run simulations for all years, one at a time, and then check how many times the tank runs dry.
You can run simulations for all years at once with the following code:

```{julia}
all_years = sort(collect(keys(rainfall_data.annual_data)))          # <1>
all_results = [run_timesteps(rainfall_data.annual_data[year], param) for year in all_years]   # <2>
any_failures = [!isempty(result.failure_dates) for result in all_results]  # <3>
println("Number of years with failures: ", sum(any_failures), " out of ", length(all_years))  # <4>
```

1. We get all the years in order.
2. We run the simulation for each year.
3. We check if any failures occurred.
4. We print the number of years with failures and the total number of years.
